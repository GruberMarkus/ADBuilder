' Usage information for input file
' ==============================================================================================
' 
' Script must be run using cscript.exe.
' 
' User must have appropriate rights in Active Directory.
' 
' User and workstation/server must be in the domain where changes shall be applied.
'
' The script should be run on a Domain Controller for performance reasons.
' 
' The scripts only adds, it does not delete or overwrite anything.
' Exception are permissions, if configured accordingly in the input file.
' 
' Valid prefixes are:
' 	"ou: "
' 	"group: "
' 	"perm: "
'	"protectou: "
'	"creategpo: "
'	"linkgpo: "
' Everything else is treated as possibly wrong syntax.
'
' Commands are processed in groups, follwing this order: OU (with ProtectOU), Group, CreateGPO, LinkGPO, Perm.
'
' Comments should start with "'" (as this line does). Comment lines do not appear in the log.
'
' A comment must be on a single line. In-Line comments are not allowed.
' 
' You can use blanks and tabs for easier reading.
' 
' Lower case and uppercase is ignored for prefixes and variable names, but not for anything else.
'
' Variables must be included between $-signs and must start with the string "Var".
' Example: $VarLastname$
'
' Format of prefix "ou: " is identical to "dsadd ou" with one exception: Distinguished names
' are not allowed, use OU1\OU2\OU3 instead.
'	ou: OU1\OU2
'	ou: OU1\OU2\OU3 -desc "description"
'
' Format of prefix "group: "
'	group: <name of group> -scope (l|g|u) -desc "<description>"
' 	group: <name of group>
'
' Format of prefix "perm: "
' 	perm: /g name of group:rights /i:inheritance
'	perm: /g grp02:ccdc;group; /i:t
'
' Sometimes, AD is busy and "perm: " fails. Therefore, the script tries to set permissions
' three times with a 10 second delay between the 1st and 2nd try and a
' 15 second delay between the 2nd and 3rd try.
'
' The prefix "protectou: " is a switch that can be turned on and off during runtime.
'	protectou: yes
'	protectou: no
' Possible values are "on" and "off". Default is "off".
'
' Protection sets the following permissions:
'	OU: "deny delete" and "deny delete subtree" for "everyone" (dsacls <DN of OU> /d S-1-1-0:SDDT)
'	Parent OU: "deny delete all child objects" for "everyone" (dsacls <DN of OU> /d S-1-1-0:DC)
'
' Format of prefix "linkgpo: "
' 	linkgpo: name of policy
'	linkgpo: default domain policy
'
' Format of prefix "creategpo: "
' 	linkgpo: name of policy
'	linkgpo: New Policy
' "creategpo" requires GPMC installed.
'
' Starting point for OUs is always the root of the domain. Parent OUs must exit.
'
' Permissions are always applied at the OU level.
'
' The script uses the following external programs:
'	dsadd.exe
'	dsacls.exe
